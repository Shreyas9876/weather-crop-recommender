ðŸŒ¾ Weather-Based Crop Recommendation System
A machine learning-powered web application that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on real-time soil and weather conditions such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.


Features

Machine learning model trained on crop recommendation dataset.
Accurate crop predictions with 99%+ accuracy.
Interactive web app built with Streamlit.
Modular code structure with separate data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and prediction scripts.
Deployable to Streamlit Cloud.
End-to-end working pipeline from dataset to deployed model.
